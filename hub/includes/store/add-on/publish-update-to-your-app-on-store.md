We recommend you to submit updates for your app add-ons through the Store. The Store allows existing users to install app updates through the Store, if your installer supports it. The Store does not provide these updates automatically to existing users. 

You can make changes to a published app's add-on at any time. To submit updates, go to the application's page in Partner Center and click  **Update** on the right-hand side for your app submission that’s live on the Store. This will create a new submission for the application, using the info from your previous submission as a starting point. 

Go to the required sections of app add-on like [Pricing and availability](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/price-and-availability.md), [Properties](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/enter-app-properties.md), [Store listing](../../../apps/publish/publish-your-app/create-app-store-listing.md) to make the changes you'd like and save them. Then click  **Submit** on Overview page.
