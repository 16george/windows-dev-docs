To run your app on a real Android device:

- Enable your Android device
- Connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. You may need to install a USB driver for your device.
Perform the following steps to enable USB debugging in the Developer options window:
Open the Settings app.
If your device uses Android v8.0 or higher, select System. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
Scroll to the bottom and select About phone.
Scroll to the bottom and tap Build number seven times.
Return to the previous screen, scroll to the bottom, and tap Developer options.
In the Developer options window, scroll down to find and enable USB debugging.
Run the app on your device as follows:

In Android Studio, select your app from the run/debug configurations drop-down menu in the toolbar.
In the toolbar, select the device that you want to run your app on from the target device drop-down menu.
Target device drop-down menu.

Click Run .
