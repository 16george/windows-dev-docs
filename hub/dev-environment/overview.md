## Transitioning between Mac and Windows

Read our [guide to transitioning between between a Mac and Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/mac-to-windows) (or Windows Subsystem for Linux) development environment, including [keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/mac-to-windows#keyboard-shortcuts), [trackpad shortcuts](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/mac-to-windows#trackpad-shortcuts), [terminal and shell equivalents](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/mac-to-windows#terminal-and-shell), and [equivalent apps and utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/mac-to-windows#apps-and-utilities).

## Stories from developers who have switched

Links to a few stories from devs moving from Mac to Windows – “It wasn’t as hard as I thought – I can still use all my favorite open source tools AND I get to use use Office and tools which are only available on Windows”.

## End to end tutorials

Break down four scenarios and walking through the tools and set-up required for each, ie 'Build an Android app using Xamarine with a MySQL database deployed on Azure', 'Build a NodeJS web app using Next.js that displays a map control and integrates real-time weather', 'Build a Python web app using Django and a Azure Vision ML model` ...?
