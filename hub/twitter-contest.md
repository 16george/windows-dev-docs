2. Read the following docs content, looking for content that could be better:
    - **Build Desktop apps** - [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/), [Win32](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/), [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wpf/), [Windows Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/winforms/)
    - **Windows UI Library** - [Controls for UWP apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/), [Xaml.Controls API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls?view=winui-2.3)
    - Build with Windows - [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about), [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/python/), [NodeJS](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/nodejs/), [Mac to Windows guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/mac-to-windows)
    - **Windows Hardware Developer** - [Tools and Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/)
3. Make corrections to a docs page by selecting the **Edit** button at the top of the page. This will take you to the markdown source file in GitHub.
