# Contribute to Windows docs and be entered to win some swag

If you use the Windows documentation, please consider becoming a part of our community of contributors.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Set up an [account with GitHub](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one, and then read our [docs contributor guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/).
2. Read the following docs on docs.microsoft.com, looking for content that could be better:
    - Desktop apps - https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/
    - Windows UI Library - [Release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/toolkits/), [API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/overview/winui/), [UI guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/)
    - Build with Windows - https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/
    - Win32  - https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/
    - Windows Drivers - https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/
3. Make corrections to a docs page by selecting the **Edit** button at the top of the page. This will take you to the markdown source file in GitHub.
4. Once your changes are complete. File your Pull Request (PR).
5. Visit the @WindowsDocs twitter account and reply to the contest post with a link to your PR.

Thank you to our community of contributors!
