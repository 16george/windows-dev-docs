# Text Extractor utility

Text Extractor is a convenient way to copy text from anywhere on your screen. This code is based on [Joe Finney's Text Grab](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Text-Grab).

## How to activate

With the activation shortcut (default: <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), you'll see an overlay on the screen. Click and hold your primary mouse button and drag to activate your capture. The text will be saved to your clipboard.

## Adjust while trying to capture

By holding <kbd>shift<kbd>, you will change from adjusting the capture region's size to moving the capture region. When you release <kbd>shift<kbd>, you will be able to resize again.

## Things to note

This uses OCR (Optical character recognition) to read the text on the screen.  It may not be perfect so you will have to do a quick proof read of the output.

## Settings

From the Settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activation shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to turn on or off always on top for that window. |
