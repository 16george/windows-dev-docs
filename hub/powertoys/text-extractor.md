# Text Extractor utility

Text Extractor is a convenient way to copy text from anywhere on your screen. This code is based on [Joe Finney's Text Grab](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Text-Grab).

## How to activate

With the activation shortcut (default: <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), you'll see an overlay on the screen. Click and hold your primary mouse button and drag to activate your capture. The text will be saved to your clipboard.

## How to deactivate

Capture mode is deactivated immediately after text in the selected region is recognized and copied to the clipboard.</br>
You can exit capture mode by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> at any moment.

## Adjust while trying to capture

By holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>, you will change from adjusting the capture region's size to moving the capture region. When you release <kbd>Shift</kbd>, you will be able to resize again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. The produced text may not be perfect, so you have to do a quick proof read of the output.
> 2. This tool uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read text on the screen.
> 3. The default language used will be based on your [Windows system language > keyboard settings](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-the-input-and-display-language-settings-in-windows-12a10cb4-8626-9b77-0ccb-5013e0c7c7a2) (OCR language packs are available for install).

## Settings

From the Settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activation shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to turn on or off this module. |

## Supported languages

Text Extractor can recognize only languages with OCR pack available.</br>
The list can be obtained via PowerShell by running next commands:
```console
PS C:\Windows\system32> [Windows.Media.Ocr.OcrEngine, Windows.Foundation, ContentType = WindowsRuntime]
PS C:\Windows\system32> [Windows.Media.Ocr.OcrEngine]::AvailableRecognizerLanguages
```

### OCR packs installation

If language is supported, then OCR language pack is installed along with language via <kbd>Language</kbd>-><kbd>Preferred languages</kbd>-><kbd>Add language menu</kbd> by default.</br>

It's possible to query all supported languages via PowerShell run as Administrator:
```console
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*' }
```

Example output:
```console
....
Name  : Language.OCR~~~el-GR~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~en-GB~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~en-US~0.0.1.0
State : Installed

Name  : Language.OCR~~~es-ES~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~es-MX~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent
....
```

If language is not available in the output, then it's not supported by OCR.</br>
If the state is <kbd>NotPresent</kbd>, then it's possible to install OCR pack for the language.</br>
For example, the next commands install OCR pack for <kbd>en-US</kbd> in PowerShell run as Administrator:
```console
PS C:\Windows\system32> $Capability = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*en-US*' }
PS C:\Windows\system32> $Capability | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
```
and these remove:
```console
PS C:\Windows\system32> $Capability = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*en-US*' }
PS C:\Windows\system32> $Capability | Remove-WindowsCapability -Online
```

## Troubleshooting

* "No Possible OCR languages are installed." message </br>
Message is shown, when there are no available languages for recognition.</br>
If OCR pack is supported, installed, but still not available and your system drive <kbd>X:</kbd> is different than <kbd>C:</kbd>, then copy <kbd>X:/Windows/OCR</kbd> folder to <kbd>C:/Windows/OCR</kbd> to fix the issue.
