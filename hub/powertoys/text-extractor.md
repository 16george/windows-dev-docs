# Text Extractor utility

Text Extractor is a convenient way to copy text from anywhere on your screen. This code is based on [Joe Finney's Text Grab](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Text-Grab).

## How to activate

With the activation shortcut (default: <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), you'll see an overlay on the screen. Click and hold your primary mouse button and drag to activate your capture. The text will be saved to your clipboard.

## How to deactivate

Capture mode is deactivated immediately after text in the selected region is recognized and copied to the clipboard.
You can exit capture mode by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> at any moment.

## Adjust while trying to capture

By holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>, you will change from adjusting the capture region's size to moving the capture region. When you release <kbd>Shift</kbd>, you will be able to resize again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. The produced text may not be perfect, so you have to do a quick proof read of the output.
> 2. This tool uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read text on the screen.
> 3. The default language used will be based on your [Windows system language > keyboard settings](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-the-input-and-display-language-settings-in-windows-12a10cb4-8626-9b77-0ccb-5013e0c7c7a2) (OCR language packs are available for install).

## Settings

From the Settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activation shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to turn on or off this module. |

## Supported languages

Text Extractor can only recognize languages that have the OCR language pack installed.

The list can be obtained via PowerShell by running the following commands:
```powershell
[Windows.Media.Ocr.OcrEngine, Windows.Foundation, ContentType = WindowsRuntime]
[Windows.Media.Ocr.OcrEngine]::AvailableRecognizerLanguages
```
### How to query for OCR language packs

The next command returns the list (PowerShell run as Administrator):
```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*' }
```

An example output:
```console
....
Name  : Language.OCR~~~el-GR~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~en-GB~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~en-US~0.0.1.0
State : Installed

Name  : Language.OCR~~~es-ES~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~es-MX~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent
....
```

If a language is not available in the output, then it's not supported by OCR.

### How to install an OCR language pack

The following commands install the OCR pack for "en-US":
```powershell
$Capability = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*en-US*' }
$Capability | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
```

### How to remove an OCR language pack

The following commands remove the OCR pack for "en-US":
```powershell
$Capability = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*en-US*' }
$Capability | Remove-WindowsCapability -Online
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No Possible OCR languages are installed." message

This message is shown when there are no available languages for recognition.

If an OCR pack is supported and installed, but still is not available and your system drive _X:_ is different than "C:", then copy `X:/Windows/OCR` folder to `C:/Windows/OCR` to fix the issue.
