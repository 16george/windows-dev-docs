# Render text with DWriteCore 

DWriteCore is the [Project Reunion](index.md) implementation of [DirectWrite](/windows/win32/directwrite/direct-write-portal). DWriteCore provides access to all current DirectWrite features for text rendering, including a device-independent text layout system, hardware-accelerated text, multi-format text, and wide language support.

For more details about DWriteCore, including guidance and code examples for programming with it, see [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview) in the DirectWrite documentation.
