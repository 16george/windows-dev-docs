</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can also clone and build the WinUI 3.0 Preview 1 version of the [Xaml Controls Gallery](#xaml-controls-gallery-winui-30-preview-1-branch).

### Configure your dev environment

Ensure that your development computer has Windows 10 April 2018 Update (version 1803 - build 17134) or newer installed.

Install Visual Studio 2019, version 16.7 Preview 1. You can download this from  [Visual Studio Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview).

You must include the following workloads when installing the Visual Studio Preview:

- .NET Desktop Development
- Universal Windows Platform development

To build C++ apps you must also include the following workloads:

- Desktop development with C++
- The *C++ (v142) Universal Windows Platform tools* optional component for the Universal Windows Platform workload

### Visual Studio project templates

To access the WinUI 3.0 Preview 1 and project templates, go to **https://aka.ms/winui3/previewdownload**

Download the Visual Studio Extension (`.vsix`) to add the WinUI project templates and NuGget package to Visual Studio 2019.

For directions on how to add the `.vsix` to Visual Studio, see [Finding and Using Visual Studio Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions?view=vs-2019#install-without-using-the-manage-extensions-dialog-box).

After installing the `.vsix` extension you can create a new WinUI 3.0 project by searching for "WinUI" and selecting one of the available C# or C++ templates.

### Visual Studio project configuration

When you create a project using one of the WinUI 3.0 Preview 1 templates, set the **Target version** to Windows 10, version 1903 (build 18362) and **Minimum version** to Windows 10, version 1803 (build 17134).

To change these values after you create a project, right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**.

### Creating a Desktop Win32 app with WinUI 3.0 Preview 1

See [Get started with WinUI 3.0 for desktop apps](get-started-winui3-for-desktop.md).

Aside from the limitations and known issues outlined below, building an app using WinUI 3.0 Preview 1 is very similar to building a UWP app with Xaml and WinUI 2.x, so most of the guidance and documentation for UWP apps and `Windows.UI` APIs is applicable.

## Preview 1 limitations and known issues

The Preview 1 release is just that, a preview. The scenarios around Desktop Win32 apps are especially new. Please expect bugs, limitations, and issues.

The following items are some of the known issues with WinUI 3.0 Preview 1. If you find an issue that isn't listed below, please let us know by contributing to an existing issue or filing a new issue on the [WinUI GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/new/choose).
