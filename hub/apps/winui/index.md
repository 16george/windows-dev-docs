# Windows UI Library (WinUI)

![WinUI logo](../images/logo-winui.png)

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is a native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows desktop and UWP applications.

By incorporating the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/) into all experiences, controls, and styles, WinUI provides consistent, intuitive, and accessible experiences using the latest user interface (UI) patterns.

With support for both desktop and UWP apps, you can build with WinUI from the ground up, or gradually migrate your existing MFC, WinForms, or WPF apps using familiar languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, and Javascript (via [React Native for Windows](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/)).

> [!Important]
> There are two versions of WinUI: **WinUI 2.x** and **WinUI 3**.

## Windows UI 2.x Library

WinUI 2.x can be used in UWP applications and incorporated into new or existing desktop applications using [XAML Islands](../desktop/modernize/xaml-islands.md).

> [!NOTE]
> WinUI 2.5 is the latest WinUI 2.x release. See the [WinUI 2.6 milestone](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/milestone/11) for a list of work planned in the next release.

The WinUI 2.x Library is closely coupled to the [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) and provides official native Windows UI controls and other UI elements for UWP apps.

By maintaining down-level compatibility with earlier versions of Windows 10, WinUI 2.x controls work even if users don't have the latest OS.

## Windows UI 3 Library (Project Reunion 0.5)

WinUI 3 is the next version of WinUI, a native Windows 10 UI platform completely decoupled from the [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/).

> [!Important]
> WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 is the first stable, supported version of WinUI 3. With this version of WinUI 3, you can create production apps and publish them to the Microsoft Store.
>
> Please use the [WinUI GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml) to provide feedback and log suggestions and issues.

By completely decoupling XAML, composition, and input APIs from the [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/), the scope of WinUI 3 includes the full Windows 10 native UI platform.

WinUI 3 is a component of [Project Reunion](../project-reunion/index.md), which provides a unified set of APIs and tools that can be used in a consistent way by any desktop app on a broad set of target Windows 10 OS versions. As a component of Project Reunion, WinUI 3 ships as a part of the Project Reunion package - see [Windows UI Library 3 - Project Reunion 0.5](winui3/index.md) for more information.

WinUI 3 is the path forward for all Windows appsâ€”you can use it as the UI layer on your native UWP or Win32 app, or you can gradually modernize your desktop app, piece by piece, with [XAML Islands](../desktop/modernize/xaml-islands.md).

All new XAML features will eventually ship as part of WinUI. The existing UWP XAML APIs that ship as part of the OS will no longer receive new feature updates. However, they will continue to receive security updates and critical fixes according to the Windows 10 support lifecycle.

Please note that the Universal Windows Platform contains more than just the XAML framework. Features such as application and security models, media pipeline, Xbox and Windows 10 shell integration, and compatibility with a broad variety of devices will continue to be developed and supported.
