# Win2D

> [!NOTE]
> Win2D on WinUI 3 is a work in progress. Some features are not supported, and some of the documentation still points to older WinUI2 concepts and classes. For information on using Win2D with UWP apps, see the [Win2D UWP Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/Win2D/WinUI2/html/Introduction.htm) on GitHub.

Win2D is an easy-to-use Windows Runtime API for immediate mode 2D graphics rendering with GPU acceleration. It is available to C#, C++ and VB developers writing apps for WinUI3. It utilizes the power of Direct2D, and integrates seamlessly with XAML.

It's ideal for creating simple games, displays such as charts, and other simple 2D graphics.

## Get Started

Win2D is available as a NuGet package, or as source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Win2D).

### Install Win2D

Add the Win2D NuGet package to your WinUI 3 app:

* From within Visual Studio, go to **Tools**, **NuGet Package Manager**, **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution..**
* Type **Win2D** into the **Search Online** box, and hit **Enter**.
* Select the **Microsoft.Graphics.Win2D** package and click **Install**, then **OK**.
* Accept the license agreement.
