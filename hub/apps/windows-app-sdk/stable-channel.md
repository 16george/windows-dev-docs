# Stable channel release notes for the Windows App SDK

The stable channel provides releases of the Windows App SDK that are supported for use by apps in production environments. Apps that use the stable release of the Windows App SDK can also be published to the Microsoft Store.

The following releases of the stable channel are currently available:

- [Version 1.0](#version-10)
- [Version 0.8](#version-08)
- [Version 0.5](#version-05)

If you'd like to upgrade an existing app from an older version of the Windows App SDK to a newer version, see [Update existing projects to the latest release of the Windows App SDK](update-existing-projects-to-the-latest-release.md). 

## Version 1.0

Version 1.0 is the latest release of the stable channel for the Windows App SDK. 1.0 supports all [stable channel features](release-channels.md#features-available-by-release-channel).

### Download 1.0 Stable Visual Studio extensions (VSIX)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Windows App SDK Visual Studio extensions (VSIX) already installed, then uninstall them before installing a new version. For directions, see [Manage extensions for Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions).

From the table below you can download the Visual Studio extensions (VSIX) for the 1.0 Stable release. If you haven't done so already, [Install developer tools](set-up-your-development-environment.md?tabs=preview).

| **1.0 Stable downloads** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Extension for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix) | Build production apps with the Windows App SDK Visual Studio extension. |
| [The `.exe` installer, and MSIX packages](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.0-stable/msix-installer) | Deploy the Windows App SDK with your app using the `.exe` installer, and MSIX packages. |

The following sections describe new and updated features, limitations, and known issues for 1.0 Stable.

### WinUI 3

**New Features**

**Important limitations**


### Windowing

The Windows App SDK provides an [AppWindow](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.windowing.appwindow) class that evolves the previous easy-to-use Windows.UI.WindowManagement.AppWindow preview class and makes it available to all Windows apps, including Win32, WPF, and WinForms. 

**New Features**
- [AppWindow](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.windowing.appwindow) is a high-level windowing API that allows for easy-to-use windowing scenarios that integrates well with the Windows user experience and with other apps. Represents a high-level abstraction of a system-managed container of the content of an app. This is the container in which your content is hosted, and represents the entity that users interact with when they resize and move your app on screen. For developers familiar with Win32, the AppWindow can be seen as a high-level abstraction of the HWND. 
- [DisplayArea](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.windowing.displayarea) represents a high-level abstraction of a HMONITOR, follows the same principles as AppWindow. 
- [DisplayAreaWatcher](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.windowing.displayareawatcher) allows a developer to observe changes in the display topology and enumerate DisplayAreas currently defined in the system. 

For more info, see [Manage app windows](windowing/windowing-overview.md).

### Input

This release enables a few input APIs, which support WinUI and provide a lower level API surface for developers to achieve more advanced input interactions. 

**New Features**
- [Pointer API]() allows developer to observe pointer event information 
- [Cursor API]() allows developer to change the cursor bitmap 
- [GestureRecognizer API](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.input.gesturerecognizer) allows developers to recognize certain gestures like drag, hold, and click when given pointer information 

**Important limitations**
Description


### App Lifecycle

Most of the App Lifecycle features already exist in the UWP platform, and have been brought into the Windows App SDK for use by all app types, especially unpackaged Console apps, Win32 apps, Windows Forms apps, and WPF apps. The Windows App SDK implementation of these features cannot be used in UWP apps, since there are equivalent features in the UWP platform itself.

Non-UWP apps can also be packaged into MSIX packages. While these apps can use some of the Windows App SDK App Lifecycle features, they must use the manifest approach where this is available. For example, they cannot use the Windows App SDK **RegisterForXXXActivation** APIs and must instead register for rich activation via the manifest.

All the constraints for packaged apps also apply to WinUI apps, which are packaged, and there are additional considerations as described below.

**Important considerations**:

- Rich activation: [GetActivatedEventArgs](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.applifecycle.appinstance.getactivatedeventargs)
  - _Unpackaged apps_: Fully usable.
  - _Packaged apps_: Usable, but these apps can also use the platform `GetActivatedEventArgs`. Note that the platform defines [Windows.ApplicationModel.AppInstance](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.appinstance) whereas the Windows App SDK defines [Microsoft.Windows.AppLifecycle.AppInstance](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.applifecycle.appinstance). And while UWP apps can use the `ActivatedEventArgs` classes, such as `FileActivatedEventArgs` and `LaunchActivatedEventArgs`, apps that use the Windows App SDK AppLifecycle feature must use the interfaces not the classes (e.g, `IFileActivatedEventArgs`, `ILaunchActivatedEventArgs`, and so on).
  - _WinUi apps_: WinUI's App.OnLaunched is given a [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchActivatedEventArgs](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.launchactivatedeventargs), whereas the platform `GetActivatedEventArgs` returns a [Windows.ApplicationModel.IActivatedEventArgs](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.IActivatedEventArgs), and the WindowsAppSDK `GetActivatedEventArgs` returns a [Microsoft.Windows.AppLifecycle.AppActivationArguments](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.applifecycle.appactivationarguments) object which can represent a platform `LaunchActivatedEventArgs`.
  - For more info, see [Rich activation](applifecycle/applifecycle-rich-activation.md).

- Register/Unregister for rich activation
  - _Unpackaged apps_: Fully usable.
  - _Packaged apps_: Not usable use the app's MSIX manifest instead.
  - For more info, see [Rich activation](applifecycle/applifecycle-rich-activation.md).

- Single/Multi-instancing
  - _Unpackaged apps_: Fully usable.
  - _Packaged apps_: Fully usable.
  - _WinUI apps_: If an app wants to detect other instances and redirect an activation, it must do so as early as possible, and before initializing any windows, etc. To enable this, the app must define DISABLE_XAML_GENERATED_MAIN, and write a custom Main (C#) or WinMain (C++) where it can do the detection and redirection.
  - [RedirectActivationToAsync](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.applifecycle.appinstance.redirectactivationtoasync) is an async call, and you should not wait on an async call if your app is running in an STA. For Windows Forms and C# WinUI apps, you can declare Main to be async, if necessary. For C++ WinUI and C# WPF apps, you cannot declare Main to be async, so instead you need to move the redirect call to another thread to ensure you don't block the STA. 
  - For more info, see [App instancing](applifecycle/applifecycle-instancing.md).

- Power/State notifications
  - _Unpackaged apps_: Fully usable.
  - _Packaged apps_: Fully usable.
  - For more info, see [Power management](applifecycle/applifecycle-power.md).

**Known issue**:

File Type associations incorrectly encode %1 to be %251 when setting the Verb handler's command line template, which crashes unpackaged Win32 apps. You can manually edit the Registry value to be %1 instead as a partial workaround. If the target file path has a space in it, then it will still fail and there is no workaround for that scenario.


### DWriteCore

DWriteCore is the Windows App SDK implementation of [DirectWrite](/windows/win32/directwrite/direct-write-portal), which is the DirectX API for high-quality text rendering, resolution-independent outline fonts, and full Unicode text and layout support. DWriteCore is a form of DirectWrite that runs on versions of Windows down to Windows 10, version 1809 (10.0; Build 17763), and opens the door for you to use it cross-platform. 

**Features**
DWriteCore contains all of the features of DirectWrite, with a few exceptions.

**Important limitations**
- DWriteCore does not contain the following DirectWrite features:  
    - Per-session fonts 
    - End-user defined character (EUDC) fonts 
    - Font-streaming APIs 
- Low-level rendering API support is partial. 
- DWriteCore doesn't interoperate with Direct2D, but you can use [IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwriteglyphrunanalysis) and [IDWriteBitmapRenderTarget](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritebitmaprendertarget).

For more information, see [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview).

### Deployment

**New Features and updates**
-  You can auto-initialize the Windows App SDK through the `WindowsPackageType project` property to load the Windows App SDK runtime and call the Windows App SDK APIs. See [Create a WinUI 3 app](../winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app.md) for instructions.
- Unpackaged apps can deploy Windows App SDK by integrating in the standalone Windows App SDK `.exe` installer into your existing MSI or setup program. For more info, see [Windows App SDK deployment guide for unpackaged apps](deploy-unpackaged-apps.md). 
- Unpackaged .NET apps can also use .NET wrapper for the [bootstrapper API](reference-framework-package-run-time.md) to dynamically take a dependency on the Windows App SDK framework package at run time. For more info about the .NET wrapper, see [.NET wrapper library](reference-framework-package-run-time.md#net-wrapper-for-the-bootstrapper-api). 
- Packaged apps can use the deployment API to verify and ensure that all required packages are installed on the machine. For more info about how the deployment API works, see the [deployment guide for packaged apps](deploy-packaged-apps.md).

**Important limitations**
- The .NET wrapper for the bootstrapper API only is only intended for use by unpackaged .NET applications to simplify access to the Windows App SDK.
- Only MSIX packaged apps that are full trust or have the [packageManagement](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations) restricted capability have the permission to use the deployment API to install the main and singleton package dependencies. Support for partial-trust packaged apps will be coming in later releases. 
- When F5 testing an x86 app which uses the [DeploymentManager.Initialize](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.windows.applicationmodel.windowsappruntime.deploymentmanager.initialize) method on an x64 system, ensure that the x64 framework is first installed by running the [WindowsAppRuntimeInstall.exe](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.0-preview2/msix-installer). Otherwise, you will encounter a **NOT_FOUND** error due to Visual Studio not deploying the x64 framework, which normally occurs through Store deployment or sideloading.


### Other limitations and known issues

- **No support for Any CPU build configuration**: When [adding the Windows App SDK](use-windows-app-sdk-in-existing-project.md) to an existing .NET application or component that supports **Any CPU**, you must specify the desired architecture: `x86`, `x64` or `arm64`.
- **Upgrading from .NET 5 to .NET 6**: When upgrading in the Visual Studio UI, you may run into build errors. As a workaround, manually update your project file's TargetFrameworkPackage to the below:

    ```xml 
        <TargetFramework>net6.0-windows10.0.19041.0</TargetFramework> 
    ```

- **C# Single-project MSIX app doesn't compile if C++ UWP Tools aren't installed**. If you have a C# Single-project MSIX project, then you'll need to install the **C++ (v14x) Universal Windows Platform Tools** optional component. 


## Version 0.8

The latest available release of the stable channel is the servicing release 0.8.2.

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download](https://aka.ms/projectreunion/vsixdownload)

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows App SDK was previously known by the code name **Project Reunion**. Some SDK assets such as the VSIX extension and NuGet packages still use the code name, but these assets will be renamed in a future release. Some areas of the documentation still use **Project Reunion** when referring to an existing asset or a specified earlier release.

### Version 0.8.0 Stable 

#### New features and updates

This release supports all [stable channel features](release-channels.md#features-available-by-release-channel).

**WinUI 3**

This release includes many bug fixes and improved stabilization across WinUI 3. These are all of the new changes in WinUI 3 since the release of WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5:

- The Pivot control has been added back in and can now be used in any WinUI 3 app.
- All bug fixes from Project Reunion v0.5.5, v0.5.6, and v0.5.7 are included with this release.
- New bug fixes, including:
    - Mouse right-click in TextBox crashes the application
    - NavigationView causes crash in UWP, Reunion 0.5 Preview
    - ProgressBar doesn't show difference between Paused and Error option
    - Crash in RichEditBox when copying/pasting/changing text style
    - Window caption buttons are misplaced when SetTitleBar is not set or null

    **For the full list of bugs addressed in this release, see [our GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/winui3/0.8/bugs-fixed).** 

- The `ColorHelper.ToDisplayName` API is no longer available. 
- The following types have been removed:
    - `Microsoft.Graphics.IGeometrySource2D`
    - `Microsoft.Graphics.IGeometrySource2DInterop`

    Use `Windows.Graphics.IGeometrySource2D` and `Windows.Graphics.IGeometrySource2DInterop` instead.

- All types in the `Microsoft.System` namespace have been moved to the `Microsoft.UI.Dispatching` namespace, including the [DispatcherQueue class](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.system/dispatcherqueue.md).

- The `AcrylicBrush.BackgroundSource` property has been removed, since `HostBackdrop` is not supported as a `BackgroundSource` in WinUI 3.

For more information on WinUI, see [Windows UI 3 Library (WinUI)](../winui/index.md).

To see WinUI 3 controls and features in action, you can clone and build the WinUI 3 Controls Gallery app [from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3), or download the app [from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/winui-3-controls-gallery/9p3jfpwwdzrc).

To get started developing with WinUI, check out the following articles:
- [WinUI 3 project templates in Visual Studio](../winui/winui3/winui-project-templates-in-visual-studio.md)
- [Get started developing apps with WinUI 3](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app)
- [WinUI 3 desktop apps and basic Win32 interop](../winui/winui3/desktop-winui3-app-with-basic-interop.md)
- [WinUI 3 API Reference](/windows/winui/api)

**DWriteCore**

This release of DWriteCore includes the following new and updated features. DWriteCore is introduced and described in the [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview).

- DWriteCore now has support for underline&mdash;see [**IDWriteTextLayout::GetUnderline**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-getunderline) and [**IDWriteTextLayout::SetUnderline**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-setunderline).
- Support for strikethrough&mdash;see [**IDWriteTextLayout::GetStrikethrough**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-getstrikethrough) and [**IDWriteTextLayout::SetStrikethrough**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextlayout-setstrikethrough).
- Support for vertical text via [**IDWriteTextLayout**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextlayout)&mdash;see [Vertical text](/windows/win32/directwrite/vertical-text).
- All of the methods of the [**IDWriteTextAnalyzer**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextanalyzer) and [**IDWriteTextAnalyzer1**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/nn-dwrite_1-idwritetextanalyzer1) interfaces are implemented.
- The [**DWriteCoreCreateFactory**](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/win32/dwrite_core/nf-dwrite_core-dwritecorecreatefactory) free function creates a factory object that is used for subsequent creation of individual DWriteCore objects.

> [!NOTE]
> [**DWriteCoreCreateFactory**](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/win32/dwrite_core/nf-dwrite_core-dwritecorecreatefactory) is functionally the same as the [**DWriteCreateFactory**](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-dwritecreatefactory) function exported by the system version of DirectWrite. The DWriteCore function has a different name to avoid ambiguity in the event that you link both `DWriteCore.lib` and `DWrite.lib`.

For DWriteCore and DirectWrite API reference, see [DWriteCore API Reference](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/win32/_dwritecore/) and [DirectWrite API Reference](/windows/win32/directwrite/reference).

**MRTCore**

- The **Build Action** for resources is automatically set when you add the resource to your project, reducing the need for manual project configuration.

#### Limitations

- This release is not currently supported on the Dev Channel of the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com). **This is fixed in version 0.8.1**.

- Desktop apps (C# or C++ desktop): This release is supported for use only in desktop apps (C++ or C#) that are packaged using MSIX. To use the Windows App SDK in unpackaged desktop apps, you must use the [experimental release channel](experimental-channel.md).

- UWP apps: This release is not supported for UWP apps that are used in production environments. To use the Windows App SDK in UWP apps, you must use the [experimental release channel](experimental-channel.md).

#### Known issues 

- WinUI 3 tooling such as Live Visual Tree, Live Property Explorer, and Hot Reload in version 0.8 and later requires Visual Studio 2019 16.11 Preview 3 and later.

- Apps currently using WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK 0.8 cannot use class libraries that use Project Reunion 0.5. Update the class libraries to use the Windows App SDK 0.8.

- .NET apps must target build 18362 or higher: Your TFM must be set to net5.0-windows10.0.18362 or higher, and your packaging project's must be set to 18362 or higher. For more info, see [GitHub issue #921](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/921).

- You may encounter a crash when switching frequently between light and dark mode.

- For .NET apps, you may receive the following error when passing in an array of enums: `Object contains non-primitive or non-blittable data.` **This is fixed in version 0.8.2**.
	
- For .NET apps, there is currently no way  to opt out of an image getting indexed as an app resource using the Visual Studio UI. To work around this, add a Directory.Build.targets (see [Customize your build - Visual Studio](/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build) for instructions) to the project and remove the image(s) as follows:
 
    - To remove specific images (note that the relative path is needed):
        ```xml
        <Project> 
        <ItemGroup> 
            <Content Remove="..\Bitmap1.bmp" />
        </ItemGroup>
        </Project>
        ```
 
    - To remove images based on metadata: 
        ```xml
        <Project>
        <ItemGroup>
            <Content Remove="@(None->WithMetadataValue('Pack','true'))" />
        </ItemGroup>
        </Project>
        ```

    A fix for this issue is planned for an upcoming release - at that point, the above workarounds will no longer be needed.

## Version 0.5
