    questions:
      - question: What should I use to build Windows apps?
        answer: |
          For Windows desktop application development, Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 could be a great choice. This combination of technologies succeeds UWP / WinUI 2 for desktop apps. See [Current Limitations of Windows App SDK / WinUI 3](current-limitations-appsdk-winui3.md) to determine if Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 will meet your needs. 
          
          Other options may be more appropriate depending on what you’re building and how you’re building it:

          - **If Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 don’t meet your needs** based on current limitations, you can use UWP / WinUI 2. 
          - **If you're targeting cross-platform:** React Native and .NET MAUI let you build cross-platform apps. .NET MAUI is a great choice for C# developers. React Native will feel familiar to JavaScript/TypeScript developers.
          - **If you're a web developer:** You can use WebView2 as an application host. This lets you use web technology to build desktop apps that can access the Windows SDK and Windows App SDK APIs. You can also use React Native for Windows.  
          - **If you're a C++ developer:** For desktop apps, Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 are a great choice. If you're building a game, consider using DirectX. C++ developers may also enjoy using [Rust for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/rust-for-windows) to build non-GUI apps.  

          There are other development technologies that may be more appropriate depending on your needs and technology preferences. [Learn more about choosing a development technology](./index.md).
      - question: Where can I find a straightforward comparison of Windows development technologies?
        answer: |
          See [Select a development technology](./index.md).
  - name: Windows App SDK and WinUI 3
    questions:
      - question: What is the Windows App SDK?
        answer: |
          The Windows App SDK is a Windows application development platform that allows you to create beautiful, modern, backwards-compatible (down to Win10 1809) desktop apps. WinUI 3 is the UI framework that ships with Windows App SDK.
      - question: What's the difference between the Windows App SDK and the Windows SDK?
        answer: |
          Both are software development kits (SDKs) that let you build Windows apps.  

          The **Windows App SDK** is a new development platform that lets you build modern desktop apps that can be installed across Windows versions (down to Win10 1809). When you use Windows App SDK to build an app, you’ll have access to the latest Windows development platform features. The Windows App SDK ships with WinUI 3. 

          The **Windows SDK** is a development platform that lets you build UWP apps and Win32/desktop apps. It's designed around Windows APIs that are coupled to particular versions of the OS.  

          The Windows App SDK doesn't replace the Windows SDK. Instead, the Windows App SDK is a complement to the Windows SDK. It provides a convenient, OS-decoupled abstraction around the rich catalogue of Windows OS APIs that you can already access using the Windows SDK. When you build apps with Windows App SDK, you might end up using some Windows SDK APIs depending on the functionality that you need. Over time, more Windows SDK functionality will be lifted into the Windows App SDK.
      - question: Can I use Windows App SDK and WinUI 3 in my existing Windows app?
        answer: |
          Note that WinUI 3 (a UI framework) ships with Windows App SDK (a Windows platform development framework).  

          Generally speaking, you can't use WinUI 3 unless you're ready to migrate your UI framework entirely. We’re working on a feature called XAML islands that allow you to mix multiple UI framework components. 

          You should be able to use elements of the Windows App SDK in any Win32/desktop app, depending on how your existing app was built. UWP apps are not supported by Windows App SDK / WinUI 3. 

          This means that **WPF/MFC/WinForms** apps can use Windows App SDK APIs that are not related to WinUI 3. Examples of such APIs include App Lifecycle, Windowing, and Toast Notifications.
      - question: Do I need to use Visual Studio to build WinUI 3 apps?
        answer: |
          We strongly recommend using Visual Studio 2022 versions 17.1 and above to develop Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 apps. Using the latest version of Visual Studio will give you access to rich development features like Hot Reload. 
 
          You may be able to use other IDEs and development workflows, but Visual Studio is currently the only officially supported IDE for Windows App SDK / WinUI 3. Note that MSBuild is required to compile projects that use XAML or Windows App SDK / WinUI 3.
      - question: What limitations are there when building with WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK?
        answer: |
          Current limitations include:
           - Apps that haven't been published through the Microsoft Store can't send push notifications.
           - Local toast notifications aren't supported yet.
           - XAML Islands aren't supported yet.
           - Media, map, and inking controls aren't supported yet.
           - Mica (Win11) and Acrylic (Win10) backgrounds aren't supported yet.
           - App lifecycle management isn't supported yet.
         
          For more details about current limitations, see [Current Limitations of Windows App SDK / WinUI 3](current-limitations-appsdk-winui3.md).
      - question: When I build an app using Windows App SDK and WinUI 3, am I building a "WinUI 3 app"?
        answer: |
          Yes - "WinUI 3 app” is the term that we recommend you use.
      - question: Can I incrementally update my WinUI 2 app to WinUI 3 by gradually replacing WinUI 2 components with WinUI 3 components?
        answer: |
          No. Windows App SDK can't be used in UWP apps, and WinUI 2 can't be mixed with WinUI 3. See [About migrating from UWP to the Windows App SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/migrate-from-uwp-to-winappsdk).
      - question: How hard is it to migrate UWP apps to Windows App SDK and WinUI 3? 
        answer: |
          Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 introduce a large number of significant changes. There are three things you need to consider: 
           1. **UI migration**. Migrating UI components will generally be straightforward. See [current limitations](current limitations link). 
           2. **App model migration**. Migrating your app model from UWP to Win32 may require a significant level of effort, depending on the scope and architecture of your application. 
           3. **.NET runtime migration**. If your UWP app targets .NET Framework, you’ll have to upgrade to .NET 6+. (?) (Pending Richard Lander) 

          See [About migrating from UWP to the Windows App SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/migrate-from-uwp-to-winappsdk).
      - question: If I have an existing UWP app in the Store, can I publish a new packaged WinUI 3 app using the same identifiers?
        answer: |
          Yes, upgraded apps can be published without having to update your application's identity. Users who have the old version will get updated to the new version. This guidance applies only to desktop apps. Xbox, HoloLens, and Surface Hub apps can't migrate to WinUI 3 yet. 
      - question: How do I package/distribute my WinUI 3 app?
        answer: | 
           See [Deployment overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/).
      - question: Where can I find Windows App SDK migration guidance?
        answer: |
          See [About migrating from UWP to the Windows App SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/migrate-from-uwp-to-winappsdk).
      - question: Do you need to use XAML if you want to use WinUI 3?
        answer: |
          No. UI controls can be created in code. But there are many benefits to representing your WinUI 3 UI in the form of declarative XAML markup, such as improved developer experience. 

          If you’re migrating from UWP/WPF to WinUI 3, you’ll probably be able to reuse a lot of your XAML markup and UI-related code (but you'll have to update some of the syntax).


      - question: Does Visual Studio have a design surface / GUI designer for WinUI 3?
        answer: |
          No. We recognize that this is a gap in the WinUI 3 developer experience. Tools like XAML Hot Reload can help in certain scenarios. You can refer to our [public roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md) to see what we're currently prioritizing.

          Yes.
        # signed off


      - question: Does Windows App SDK include WinUI 2?
        answer: |
          WinUI 2 and UWP are not included as part of Windows App SDK. WinUI 2 ships as a standalone NuGet package; WinUI 3 ships within Windows App SDK.
        # signed off.


      - question: Are WinUI 2 and WinUI 3 built on the same technology?
        answer: |
          Not quite. WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK are new technologies that replace WinUI 2 / UWP. Many UWP features are being ported to the Windows App SDK on a prioritized basis. Eventually, the WinApp SDK will support most UWP functionality, along with new and improved features. There are many things that you can do in WinUI 3 that you can't do in WinUI 2, like calling any I/O Win32 APIs without restriction.
        # sign off


      - question: Can I use WinUI 3 without using Windows App SDK?
        answer: |
          No. Since WinUI 3 is part of the Windows App SDK, by using WinUI 3 you're actually using the Windows App SDK.
        # sign off


      - question: Can I use WinUI 3 in Win32 apps?
        answer: |
          Yes. WinUI 3 is based on win32. But WinUI 3 UI controls can't be mixed with Win32 UI controls within the same surface. You could create a WinUI 3 app that has a window that uses win32 UI controls.

      - question: What's the difference between XAML Islands and WinUI 3?
        answer: |
          XAML Islands lets you host UWP content within win32 apps. XAML Islands is the foundation of WinUI 3. Under the hood, WinUI 3 uses desktop XAML manager APIs. But WinUI 3 gives you a scoped-down version of XAML Islands.

      - question: Can I use XAML Islands with WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK?
        answer: |
          No. Although WinUI 3 and XAML Islands share technology, they can't be mixed.

      - question: If I use WinUI 3, will my app look modern on both Windows 11 and Windows 10?
        answer: |
          Yes, your app's UI will inherit the latest Fluent UI design principles on all supported versions of Windows 11 and Windows 10 down to version 1809 in both packaged and unpackaged scenarios.

  - name: UWP and WinUI 2
    questions:
      - question: Can UWP apps be distributed outside of the Microsoft Store?

          Yes, as long as they're signed with a valid certificate.
        # sign off
      - question: Can I mix UWP UI controls with Win32, WPF, or WinForms UI controls?
        answer: |
          Yes - XAML Islands lets you do this. [Learn more about XAML Islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/xaml-islands). Note that XAML Islands depends on .NET core 3.1, which is why you can't use it with Windows App SDK / WinUI 3.
        # sign off with cleanup needed
        # system xaml islands that we have today is supported for C++ and .net but .net core 3.1 only
        # means if you have .net framework, you can't use XAML islands. .NET 5/6/standard - no - only .net core 3.1 - means support of .net core 3.1 ends this year. So officially, XAML islands won't be supported in .NET - only C++
        # Remember that XAML Islands are only supported in projects with .net core 3.1 - we want devs to use WinUI 3 - when we publish xaml islands in 1.2, everyone (c++ .net etc) will be able to use WinUI 3. WinUI3/XAML Islands suppports .net 5 etc.
  - name: Cross-platform development
    questions:
      - question: Can I start with WinUI 3 and App SDK, and later integrate .NET MAUI if I eventually want to target cross-platform scenarios?
        answer: |
          No. Although .NET MAUI apps use Windows App SDK and WinUI 3 when running on Windows, we recommend starting with .NET MAUI if you anticipate the need to target multiple platforms.
      - question: What should I use if I want to build apps that work on Windows and Xbox?
        answer: |
          If your app needs to support both Windows and Xbox, we recommend using the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Windows App SDK and WinUI 3 can be used to build Windows apps, but these apps won't work on Xbox. For game development, we recommend using [Microsoft Game Development Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/GDK).
        # TODO: Are there future plans to allow devs to build xbox apps using win app sdk?

      - question: What should I use if I want to build apps that work on Windows, Hololens and Mixed Reality?
        answer: |
          It's not currently possible to build one app that works on Windows, Hololens, and Mixed Reality. We recommend using Windows App SDK and WinUI 3 to build Windows apps. For Hololens apps, we recommend using either UWP or OpenXR + Win32. [Learn more about OpenXR](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/native/openxr). Mixed Reality apps can be built [using the Windows SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools).

  - name: Packaging, deployment, and updates
    questions:
      - question: What's the difference between MSIX-packaged, unpackaged, and sparse-packaged apps?
        answer: |
          MSIX-packaged apps use MSIX to give users an easy installation, uninstallation, and update experience. Unpackaged apps don't use MSIX. Sparse-packaged apps don't use MSIX either, but they do retain package identity. Each type can be published to the Microsoft Store, but we encourage you to MSIX-package your app to ensure that end-users enjoy a seamless installation and update experience.
        # signed off
      - question: Can I create an unpackaged WinUI 3 app?
        answer: |
          Yes. WinUI 3 apps without MSIX packaging can be deployed on Windows versions 1809 and above. See [Create a WinUI 3 app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui3/create-your-first-winui3-app).

      - question: Can I use Windows App SDK without using MSBuild?
        answer: |
          No - WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK require MSBuild, which is why Visual Studio is a prerequisite to Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 application development.

  - name: Performance and optimization
    questions:
      - question: Does Windows App SDK support native compilation?
        answer: |
          C++ apps will be compiled natively because they don't depend on the .NET runtime. Otherwise, if your app does depend on the .NET runtime, Windows App SDK will use Intermediate Language (IL) to compile at runtime. You can precompile binaries in .NET using Ready to Run.
        # pending product signoff
        # native is faster - memory consumption lower
        # every .net app is managed - non-native - but in UWP, used something called .net native, in compilation time, assemblies of .net are translated into .net native code - still need the runtime, but it's compiled into native bits.
        # uwp using .net native, appsdk using standard .net 5 (doesn't support AOT - reason why no update path from UWP, so UWP builders are disappointed by lack of AOT performance benefits for end-users)
        # removed support for .net native is that we pay a cost for having two frameworks - couldn't afford this cost.
        # .net team has more resources - moves fast - so we use C#/winrt projection to use .net 5 instead of trying to keep up
        # eg in .net 3.1 - there's a specific winrt projection - means every time a new .net version is made (eg version 5), we have to wait on specific projections, means appsdk team is tightly coupled to .net team - need to decouple from .net team, and then use the latest bits - remove projection from .net and use C#/winrt projections that we control.
        # AOT vs JIT - by default, JIT is used, compiles on the fly, AOT compiles ahead of time into native code
      - question: What can I do to make my Windows app feel great to end-users?

  - name: Deprecations and migrations
    questions:
      - question: Are UWP / WinUI 2 deprecated?
        answer: |
          No. UWP and WinUI 2 are still fully supported for production scenarios and the Windows SDK will continue to support UWP project types, including bug, reliability, and security fixes. UWP will be supported while UWP features are being ported to the Windows App SDK with the caveat that .NET 5/6 won't be coming to UWP.

          Many UWP features are being ported to the Windows App SDK on a prioritized basis. Eventually, the Windows App SDK will support most UWP functionality, along with new and improved features.

      - question: When should I migrate a UWP + WinUI 2 app to WinUI 3?
        # "What are the reasons to -> when should I" based on an assumption that people are more likely to search for "when should I" vs "what are the reasons"
        answer: |
          UWP developers don't need to migrate yet. WinUI 2 and the Windows SDK will continue to support UWP project types, including bug, reliability, and security fixes. If you want to update your UWP app to use the Windows App SDK or .NET 5, you can migrate your project to a desktop project type by following our migration guidance (see [Migrate from UWP to the Windows App SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk-ovw)). Note that .NET 5/6 won't be coming to UWP project types.
          Otherwise, there's no immediate need to migrate your UWP app to WinUI 3. We're working on porting the most popular UWP features to Windows App SDK (which includes WinUI 3), but you can use UWP if Windows App SDK doesn't yet meet your needs.

        # sign off with edits
        # another reason - if at some point your app needs access to os resources that need access outside sandbox of security - eg selecting a system folder - this requires winui3. Access to registry etc.  UWP has a sandbox of security - blocks app access to pieces of the OS. win32 expands this access.
      - question: When should I *not* migrate a UWP + WinUI 2 app to WinUI 3?
        answer: |
          UWP/WinUI 2 may have features that are not yet ported to WinUI 3. One example of this is map controls. You can check the Windows App SDK roadmap to see what we're prioritizing. Otherwise, we recommend continuing to use UWP if you're building for Xbox, Surface Hub, or Hololens.

      - question: Is the Windows Runtime (WinRT) deprecated?
        answer: |
          WinRT refers to a type of API. WinRT APIs are the evolution of COM APIs, and they're alive and kicking. WinAppSDK and WinUI 3 APIs are WinRT APIs because they run on the win32 application model.
        # signed off
        # notes for me: windows uses something called COM components to expose APIs to other languages - every API that you want to use externally, will be implementing a COM interface that is registered in the registry - why registry is so large. Thsi is how the OS makes sure that APIs can be used across platforms. Windows RunTime was about taking COM and allow libraries like .net to take advantage of the com components in an easy way. This extends com components with new interfaces that every library fulfilles - allows for projections to be created. Right now in windows, every time you create a new library, it uses the winrt model. With win appsdk, all libraries are exposed via winrt. Every winrt component requires the COM binary + IDL file which is similar to IDL in .net, which describes the interface - every platform that wants to consume the winrt component, needs to read the IDL - which is just an interface/contract. WinRT extends COM components that makes it easier to consume/
