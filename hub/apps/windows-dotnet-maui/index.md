# .NET MAUI on Windows

.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base. Developers who want to build Windows apps with .NET MAUI will leverage the [Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3](../winui/winui3/index.md) on Windows 11 and Windows 10 version 1809 or higher.
