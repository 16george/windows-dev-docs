# Tutorial: Create a .NET MAUI app with C# Markup and the Community Toolkit

Build a .NET MAUI app with a user interface created without XAML by using C# Markup from the [.NET MAUI Community Toolkit](/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/).

## Introduction

## Setting up the environment

If you haven't already set up your environment for .NET MAUI development, please follow the steps to [Get started with .NET MAUI on Windows](index.md#get-started-with-net-maui-on-windows).

## Creating the .NET MAUI project

> [!NOTE]
> If you are already familiar with setting up a .NET MAUI project, you can skip to the next section.

1. Launch Visual Studio, and in the start window click **Create a new project** to create a new project.

2. In the **Create a new project** window, select **MAUI** in the All project types drop-down, select the **.NET MAUI App** template, and click the **Next** button:

3. In the **Configure your new project** window, give your project a name, choose a location for it, and click the **Next** button.

4. In the **Additional information** window, click the **Create** button.

5. Wait for the project to be created, and for its dependencies to be restored.

6. In the Visual Studio toolbar, press the **Windows Machine** button to build and run the app. Click the **Click me** button and verify that the button content updates with the number of clicks.

Now that you have verified that the .NET MAUI app on Windows is working as expected, we can integrate the MVVM Toolkit and C# Markup packages. In the next section, you'll add these packages to your new project.
