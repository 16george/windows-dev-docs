# Distribute a Windows Desktop Bridge app

Publish your desktop bridge app to a Windows store or sideload it onto one or more devices.  

## Distribute your app by publishing it to a Windows store

The [Windows app store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps) is a convenient way for customers to get your app. Publish your app to that store to reach the broadest audience.

Alternatively, you can distribute your app internally to users across your organization by using the [Windows Store for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/business-store).

Whichever store you ultimately choose, start by filling out [this form](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/projects/campaigns/desktop-bridge), and Microsoft will contact you to start the onboarding process.

## Distribute your app without placing it onto a Windows store

If you'd rather avoid the store, you can manually distribute apps to one or more devices.

This might make sense if you build apps for use in a small team and you're willing to handle the signing, hosting, and deployment of your app.

It can also make sense in cases where you want finer control over the distribution experience and don't want to get involved with the Windows Store certification process.
