The Desktop Bridge is a set of technologies that help you to convert your Windows desktop application (for example, Win32, Windows Forms, or WPF) or game to a UWP app or game. A converted app is packaged, serviced, and deployed in the form of a UWP app package (an .appx or an .appxbundle) that targets Windows 10 Desktop.

There are two parts to this technology. The first part is the conversion process that takes your existing binaries and repackages them as a UWP package. Your code is still the same, it's just packaged differently.

The second part comprises runtime technologies in the Windows Anniversary update that enable a UWP package to have executables that run as full trust instead of in an app container. This technology also gives a converted app a package identity. Your app will need that identity to use some UWP APIs.

These videos walk you through the entire process of bringing your desktop app to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).

## Benefits

Here are some reasons to convert your Windows desktop application:

**Streamlined deployment**. Apps and games that use the bridge have a great deployment experience. This experience ensures that users can confidently install an app and update it. If a user chooses to uninstall the app, it's removed completely with no trace left behind. This reduces time authoring setup experiences and keeping users up-to-date.

**Automatic updates and licensing**. Your app can participate in the Windows Store's built-in licensing and automatic update facilities. Automatic update is a highly reliable and efficient mechanism, because only the changed parts of files are downloaded.

**Increased reach and simplified monetization**. Choosing to distribute through the Windows Store expands your reach to millions of Windows 10 users, who can acquire apps, games and in-app purchases with local payment options.

**Add UWP features**.  At your own pace, you can add UWP features to your app's package, like a XAML user-interface, live tile updates, UWP background tasks, app services, and many more.

**Broadened use-cases across device**. Using the bridge, you can gradually migrate your code to the Universal Windows Platform to reach every Windows 10 device, including phones, Xbox One and HoloLens.

## Prepare

Do you plan to publish your app to the [Windows app store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps). If so, start by filling out [this form](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/projects/campaigns/desktop-bridge). Microsoft will contact you to start the onboarding process. As part of this process, you'll reserve a name in the store, and obtain information that you'll need to create Windows app package.

Next, review the article [Prepare your app for the Desktop to UWP Bridge](desktop-to-uwp-prepare.md) and address any of the issues that apply to your app before you convert it. You might not have to make many changes to your app before you convert it. However, there are a some situations that might require you to tweak your app before you convert it.

## Convert

Here are some tools that you can use to convert your app to a desktop bridge app.

### Desktop App Converter

This tool automatically converts your app for you. This tool can be very convenient in cases where your app makes lots of system modifications, or if you have any uncertainty about what your installer does.

The Desktop App Converter also does a few extra things for you. Here's a few of them.

* Automatically register your preview handlers, thumbnail handlers, property handlers, firewall rules, URL flags.

* Automatically register file type mappings that enable users to group files by using the **Kind** column in File Explorer.

* Register your public COM servers.

* Generate a certificate to that you can use to run your app.

* Validate your app against Desktop Bridge and Windows Store requirements.

See [Convert an app using the Desktop App Converter (Desktop to UWP Bridge)](desktop-to-uwp-run-desktop-app-converter.md)

### Manual conversion

If you like granular control over your conversion, you can create a manifest file, and then run the **MakeAppx.exe** tool to create your Windows app package.

This approach might make sense if you're familiar with the changes that your installer makes to the system, or if you don't have an installer and the way that you install your app is by physically copying files to a folder location or by using commands like **xcopy**. Although don't let the absense of an installer move you to manually convert your app. You can use the Desktop App Converter to convert your app even if you don't have an installer.

See [Convert an app manually (Desktop to UWP Bridge)](desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion.md).

### Visual Studio

This option is similar to the manual option described above except Visual Studio does a few things for you such as generate an app package and the visual assets for your app. Think of Visual Studio as a tool that you can use to manually convert your app along with a few extra conveniences.

See [Package a .NET app by using Visual Studio (Desktop to UWP Bridge)](desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net.md)

### Third-party installer

 Several popular third-party products and installers now support the Desktop to UWP Bridge. You can use them to generate MSI installers or converted app packages with only a few clicks. While we don't produce documentation on how to use these tools, visit their websites to learn more.

* [Advanced Installer by Caphyon](http://www.advancedinstaller.com/)
* [InstallShield by Flexera](http://www.flexerasoftware.com/producer/products/software-installation/installshield-software-installer)
* [WiX by FireGiant](https://www.firegiant.com/r/appx)
* [RAD Studio by Embarcadero](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/windows-10-store-desktop-bridge)
* [InstallAware](https://www.installaware.com/appx.htm)

## Enhance

Once you've converted your apps to desktop bridge apps, you can light them up with features such as live tiles, and push notifications. Some of these capabilities can significantly improve the engagement level of your app and they cost you very little time to add. Some enhancements require a bit more code. In all, you'll have access to a wide range of UWP APIs. for a complete list, see [UWP APIs available to Window Desktop Bridge apps](desktop-to-uwp-supported-api.md).

Check out these samples to get ideas.
* [Desktop app bridge to UWP Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/DesktopBridgeToUWP-Samples)
* [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples)

If your app needs to integrate with the system (For example: establish firewall rules), you can do alot of things without having write any code at all. You'll just add some XML to your app package. You can use XML to do things like start a process when the user logs on, integrate your app into File Explorer, and add your app a list of print targets that appear in other apps.

See [Integrate your app with Windows 10 (Windows Desktop Bridge)](desktop-to-uwp-extensions.md).

## Migrate

Using the bridge, you can gradually migrate your older code to UWP while still retaining the ability to run and publish your app on Windows Desktop. Once youâ€™re fully migrated to UWP (and your app no longer contains any WPF/Win32 components), you can reach all Windows devices including phones, Xbox One and HoloLens.

## Debug

You can debug your app by using Visual Studio. See [Debug apps converted with the Desktop Bridge](desktop-to-uwp-debug.md).

If you're interested in the internals of how the Desktop Bridge works under the covers, see [Behind the scenes of the Desktop Bridge](desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes.md).

## Validate

To give your app the best chance of being published on the Windows Store or becoming [Windows Certified](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=309666), validate and test it locally before you submit it for certification.

If you're using the DAC to convert your app, you can use the new ``-Verify`` flag to validate your package against the Desktop Bridge and Store requirements. See [Convert an app, sign the app, and prepare it for store submission](desktop-to-uwp-run-desktop-app-converter.md#optional-parameters).

If you're using Visual Studio, you can validate your app from the **Create App Packages** wizard. See [Create an app package](../packaging/packaging-uwp-apps.md#create-an-app-package).

To run the tool manually, see [Windows App Certification Kit](../debug-test-perf/windows-app-certification-kit.md).

To review the list of tests that the Windows App Certification uses to validate your app, see [Windows Desktop Bridge app tests](../debug-test-perf/windows-desktop-bridge-app-tests.md).

## Distribute

You can distribute your app by publishing it to one of our Windows Stores or by sideloading it onto other systems.

See [Distribute apps converted with the Desktop Bridge](desktop-to-uwp-distribute.md).
