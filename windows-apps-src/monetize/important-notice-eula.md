# Important Notice - EULA




Read the end user license agreement (EULA) in its entirety.

The EULA contains important information **including text that must appear within your own privacy policy and/or terms of use statement** when your app uses advertising. Make sure your app complies with all sections of the EULA, including those related to **Redistribution Requirements**, **Data Collection** and **Use and Additional Agreements**.

The EULA can be found in the folder where your Extension SDKs are located. Your folder may be different depending on the options you chose during installation. The default installation path is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows Kits\\10\\ExtensionSDKs\\Microsoft.AdMediator.Universal\\1.0.
