# Change the billing state of a subscription for a user

Use this method in the Windows Store purchase API to change the billing state of a subscription add-on for a given user. You can cancel, extend, or refund a subscription, or toggle the setting to automatically renew the subscription at the end of the subscription period.

> [!NOTE]
> This method can only be used by developer accounts that have been provisioned by Microsoft to be able to create subscription add-ons for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. Subscription add-ons are currently not available to most developer accounts.

## Prerequisites

To use this method, you will need:

* An Azure AD access token that was created with the `https://onestore.microsoft.com` audience URI.
* A Windows Store ID key that represents the identity of the user who has an entitlement to the subscription you want to change.

For more information, see [Manage product entitlements from a service](view-and-grant-products-from-a-service.md).
