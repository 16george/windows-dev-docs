# Code examples for the submission API

This section provides code examples for using the *Windows Store submission API* in several different programming languages.

>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the code examples listed below, we also provide an open-source PowerShell module which implements a command-line interface on top of the Windows Store submission API. This module is called [StoreBroker](https://aka.ms/storebroker). You can use this module to manage your app, flight, and add-on submissions from the command line instead of calling the Windows Store submission API directly, or you can simply browse the source to see more examples for how to call this API. The StoreBroker module is actively used within Microsoft as the primary way that many first-party applications are submitted to the Store. For more information, see our [StoreBroker page on GitHub](https://aka.ms/storebroker).
