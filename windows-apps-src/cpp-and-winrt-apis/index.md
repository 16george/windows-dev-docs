Introduced in Windows 10, version 1803, the Windows SDK includes C++/WinRT.

C++/WinRT is a standard C++ language projection for Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs, implemented solely in header files, and designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern Windows API. With C++/WinRT, you can author and consume WinRT APIs using any standards-compliant C++ compiler.

| Topic | Description |
| - | - |
| [Introduction to C++/WinRT](intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt.md) | An introduction to C++/WinRT&mdash;a standard C++ language projection for WinRT APIs. |
| [Strings](strings.md) | With C++/WinRT, you can call WinRT APIs using standard C++ wide string types, or you can use the [**winrt::hstring**](/uwp/cpp-ref-for-winrt/hstring?branch=live) type. |
| [Standard C++ data types](std-cpp-data-types.md) | With C++/WinRT, you can call WinRT APIs using Standard C++ data types. |
| [Events; how to author and handle](events-author-handle.md) | This topic demonstrates how to author a Windows Runtime Component containing a type that raises events. It also demonstrates an app that consumes the component and handles the events. |
| [Runtimeclass instantiation, activation, and construction](ctors-runtimeclass-activation.md) | This topic describes two different ways to instantiate a runtimeclass with C++/WinRT. The way you go depends on whether the runtimeclass is implemented in the same compilation unit as the consuming code, or in a different one. |
