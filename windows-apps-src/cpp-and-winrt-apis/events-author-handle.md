This topic demonstrates how to author a Windows Runtime Component containing a runtime class representing a bank account, which raises an event when its balance goes into debit. It also demonstrates a Core App that consumes the bank account runtime class, calls a function to adjust the balance, and handles any events that result.

## Windows::Foundation::EventHandler&lt;T&gt; and TypedEventHandler&lt;T&gt;
If you want to raise an event from a runtime class implemented in a Windows Runtime Component, then you should use [**Windows::Foundation::EventHandler**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.eventhandler) or [**TypedEventHandler**](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.eventhandler) for your event's delegate type. The type parameters must be Windows Runtime types, so primitive types are allowed as well as third-party runtime classes.

The compiler will help you with a "*must be WinRT type*" error if you forget this constraint.

## winrt::delegate&lt;...T&gt;
If you want to raise an event from a C++ type (authored and consumed within the same project), then you can use C++/WinRT's **winrt::delegate&lt;...T&gt;** for your event's delegate type. In that case, the type parameter needn't be a Windows Runtime type.

## Create a Windows Runtime Component (BankAccountWRC)
Begin by creating a new project in Microsoft Visual Studio. Create a **Visual C++ Windows Runtime Component (C++/WinRT)** project, and name it *BankAccountWRC* (for "bank account Windows Runtime Component").

The newly-created project contains a file named `Class.idl`. Rename that file `BankAccountWRC.idl` so that, when you build, your component's Windows Runtime metadata file is named for the component itself. In `BankAccountWRC.idl`, define your interface as in the listing below.

```idl
// BankAccountWRC.idl
namespace BankAccountWRC
{
	runtimeclass BankAccount
	{
		BankAccount();
		event Windows.Foundation.EventHandler<Single> AccountIsInDebit;
		void AdjustBalance(Single value);
	};
}
```

Save the file and build the project. The build won't succeed just yet. But, during the build process, the `midl.exe` tool is run to create your component's Windows Runtime metadata file (which is `\BankAccountWRC\Debug\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC.winmd`). Then, the `cppwinrt.exe` tool is run (with the `-component` option) to generate source code files to support you in authoring your component. These files include stubs to get you started implementing the `BankAccount` runtime class that you declared in your IDL. Those stubs are `\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC\Generated Files\sources\BankAccount.h` and `BankAccount.cpp`.

Copy the stub files `BankAccount.h` and `BankAccount.cpp` from `\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC\Generated Files\sources\` into the project folder, which is `\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC\`. In **Solution Explorer**, make sure **Show All Files** is toggled on. Right-click the stub files that you copied, and click **Include In Project**. Also, right-click `Class.h` and `Class.cpp`, and click **Exclude From Project**.

Now, let's open `BankAccount.h` and `BankAccount.cpp` and implement our runtime class. In `BankAccount.h`, add two private members to the implementation (*not* the factory implementation) of BankAccount.

```cppwinrt
// BankAccount.h
...
namespace winrt::BankAccountWRC::implementation
{
    struct BankAccount : BankAccountT<BankAccount>
    {
        ...

	private:
		event<Windows::Foundation::EventHandler<float>> accountIsInDebitEvent;
		float balance{ 0.f };
	};
}
...
```

In `BankAccount.cpp`, implement the functions like this.

```cppwinrt
// BankAccount.cpp
...
namespace winrt::BankAccountWRC::implementation
{
	event_token BankAccount::AccountIsInDebit(Windows::Foundation::EventHandler<float> const& handler)
	{
		return accountIsInDebitEvent.add(handler);
	}

	void BankAccount::AccountIsInDebit(event_token const& token)
	{
		accountIsInDebitEvent.remove(token);
	}

	void BankAccount::AdjustBalance(float value)
	{
		balance += value;
		if (balance < 0.f) accountIsInDebitEvent(*this, balance);
	}
}
```

The implementation of the **AdjustBalance** function raises the **AccountIsInDebit** event if the balance goes negative.

If any warnings prevent you from building, then set the project property **C/C++** > **General** > **Treat Warnings As Errors** to **No (/WX-)**, and build the project again.

## Create a Core App (BankAccountCoreApp) to test the Windows Runtime Component
Now create a new project (either in your `BankAccountWRC` solution, or in a new one). Create a **Visual C++ Core App (C++/WinRT)** project, and name it *BankAccountCoreApp*.

Add a reference, and browse to `\BankAccountWRC\Debug\BankAccountWRC\BankAccountWRC.winmd`. Click **Add**, and then **OK**. Now build BankAccountCoreApp. If you see an error that the payload file `readme.txt` doesn't exist, then exclude that file from the Windows Runtime Component project, rebuild it, then rebuild BankAccountCoreApp.

During the build process, the `cppwinrt.exe` tool is run to process the referenced `.winmd` file into source code files containing projected types to support you in consuming your component. The header for the projected types for your component's runtime classes&mdash;named `BankAccountWRC.h`&mdash;is generated into the folder `\BankAccountCoreApp\BankAccountCoreApp\Generated Files\winrt\`.

Include that header in `App.cpp`.

```cppwinrt
#include "winrt/BankAccountWRC.h"
```

Also in `App.cpp`, add the following code to instantiate a BankAccount (using the projected type's default constructor), register an event handler, and then cause the account to go into debit.

```cppwinrt
struct App : implements<App, IFrameworkViewSource, IFrameworkView>
{
	BankAccountWRC::BankAccount bankAccount;
	event_token eventToken;
	...
	
	void Initialize(CoreApplicationView const &)
	{
		eventToken = bankAccount.AccountIsInDebit([](const auto &, float balance)
		{
			assert(balance < 0.f);
		});
	}
	...

	void Uninitialize()
	{
		bankAccount.AccountIsInDebit(eventToken);
	}
	...

	void OnPointerPressed(IInspectable const &, PointerEventArgs const & args)
	{
		bankAccount.AdjustBalance(-1.f);
		...
	}
	...
};
```

Each time you click the window, you subtract 1 from the bank account's balance. To demonstrate that the event is being raised as expected, put a breakpoint inside the lambda expression, run the app, and click inside the window.

## Events raised after object destruction
In rare cases with XAML UI framework objects, an event is raised on an object that has been finalized. If you encounter this situation, then register your event handler using a lambda that captures a weak reference to the object's *this* pointer. For more info about weak references, see [Weak references in C++/WinRT](weak-references.md).

This code example uses the [**SwapChainPanel.CompositionScaleChanged**](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.swapchainpanel.compositionscalechanged) event as an illustration.

```cppwinrt
winrt::Windows::UI::Xaml::Controls::SwapChainPanel m_swapChainPanel;
winrt::event_token m_compositionScaleChangedEventToken;

void RegisterEventHandler()
{
	m_compositionScaleChangedEventToken = m_swapChainPanel.CompositionScaleChanged([weakReferenceToThis{ get_weak() }]
		(Windows::UI::Xaml::Controls::SwapChainPanel const& sender,
		Windows::Foundation::IInspectable const& object)
	{
		if (auto strongReferenceToThis = weakReferenceToThis.get())
		{
			strongReferenceToThis->OnCompositionScaleChanged(sender, object);
		}
	});
}

void OnCompositionScaleChanged(Windows::UI::Xaml::Controls::SwapChainPanel const& sender,
	Windows::Foundation::IInspectable const& object)
{
	// Here, we know that the this pointer is valid to use.
}
```

In the lamba capture clause, a temporary variable is created, representing a weak reference to *this*. In the body of the lambda, if a strong reference to *this* can be obtained, then the event handler function is called. In the handler, *this* can safely be used.
