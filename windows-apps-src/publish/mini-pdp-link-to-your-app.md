# Link to your app

You can help customers discover your app by linking to your app's listing in the Microsoft Store on Windows.

## Getting the link to your app's Store listing  

To get the URL for your app's Store listing, navigate to the app's App identity page in the App management section of Partner Center. The URL is in the format https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/[your app's Store ID].

When a customer clicks this link, it opens the web-based listing page for your app. On  Windows devices, customers can launch the Store app.
  
## Linking to your app's Store listing with the Microsoft Store badge

You can link directly to your app's listing with a custom badge to let customers know your app is in the Microsoft Store. The badge can provide users with Windows devices a streamlined acquisition experience via the popup Store experience.

To create your badge, visit the Microsoft Store badges page. You'll need to have your app's 12-character Store ID in order to generate the badge and link. You can find your app's Store ID on the App identity page in the App management section   of Partner Center.
