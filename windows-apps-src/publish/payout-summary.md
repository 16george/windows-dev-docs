# Payout summary

The **Payout summary** shows you details about the money you’ve earned with Microsoft. It also lets you know when you’ll receive payments and how much you'll be paid.

If you sell products in the Azure Marketplace, you’ll also see info on successful payouts in the **Payout summary**. For more details regarding Azure Marketplace payment, see the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Participation Policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=722436) and the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=699560 ).

## Transaction history page

This page displays all of your individual earnings, including the date, type, and earning for each. You can select a time period to view, and you can also filter by Enrollment ID, Program, Payment ID, Earning type, Lever, and Status. Data is available for the current fiscal year (July 1 – June 30) and the previous two fiscal years.

To see more details about an earning, select the down arrow at the right-hand side of the page. This will display the lever, revenue amount, and product. If for some reason any of this data is unavailable, but you need access to it, contact [support](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/support)]. If the earning is the result of an adjustment, and not a transaction, the product fields will not be displayed.

To export any of the transaction data on this page, select Export and then follow directions on the Export data page. Files exported from the Transaction History page show data in transaction currency, earnings in both transaction currency and US dollars,and the paid value in pay to currency.

## Export data page

Follow the instructions on this page to export the data you want.

Notes:

- The Export data page does not refresh on its own. You may need to refresh the page manually to see the most recent data.
- Your filter may result in a No data available error. This probably means you’ve left the default time period selected at three months, and then selected a Payment ID from an earning that’s outside of that period. Expand your time period and try again.
