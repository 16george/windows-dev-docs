# pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation

As of April 1st, 2016, all payments for Microsoft Advertising earnings are now made through your Dev Center payout account. Please visit your [Windows Dev Center dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/dashboard/apps/overview) for all ad management and payout reporting. 

As of October 1st, 2016, you no longer have access to the pubCenter dashboard. If you haven’t linked any of your pubCenter accounts to a Dev Center account, [contact support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=393643).

Your Dev Center account has a single tax profile that will be used for all your payouts, and you receive a single payout for all of your Microsoft Advertising earnings (including any previously linked pubCenter accounts) in the payout account (PayPal or bank account) that you set up in Dev Center. The payout amount will be converted to the currency of your Dev Center account country or region.
