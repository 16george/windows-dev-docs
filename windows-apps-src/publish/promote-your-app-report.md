# Promote your app report

The **Promote your app** report in the Windows Dev Center dashboard lets you see how your app promotion ad campaigns are performing.

To see the report, select **Promotions** in the top navigation menu. At the top of the **Promote your app** page, you'll see a list of your ad campaigns and performance metrics in tabular form.

At the bottom of the page, you'll see performance metrics displayed as lines plotted on a graph, with the selected metric on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. Select the tab headers to view data for these performance metrics:

-   **Impressions**: The number of times your ad has been shown to customers.
-   **Clicks**: The number of times a customer has clicked on your ad.
-   **Conversions**: If your campaign objective is to increase installs of your app, a conversion is the number of times someone viewed your ad and then installed your app within 24 hours. If your campaign objective is to increase engagement in your app, a conversion is the number of times someone viewed your ad and then opened your app within 24 hours. See below for more information about install tracking and how conversions are measured.
-   **Spend**: The amount of money that you've spent on each campaign.

You can display performance data for up to six different ad campaigns at a time. Select **More campaigns** to choose which campaigns to display. You can also select the minus symbol by a displayed campaign to remove it.

### What is install tracking?

Running an install ad campaign through **Promote your app** on Dev Center provides much-needed exposure to advertise your apps. Ad impressions are shown to customers who are most likely to be interested in the app, and the customers click on the ad and install the app from the Store. Previously, it was hard to distinguish between installs that were the result of an ad campaign versus installs that came from other sources.

The **Promote your app** report shows you how many installs you've earned by running your ad campaign. This only represents downloads that are a direct outcome of your ad campaign, and does not include downloads from other sources.

By monitoring installs for your ad campaigns, you can measure the true return on investment from the money you spend on promoting your apps. It also helps you compare the cost of obtaining a new customer with the lifetime value of your customers.

### How are conversions measured?

**Promote your app** ad campaigns deliver ad impressions within other apps. Customers who are exposed to the ad are likely to install the app in one of two ways: by clicking the ad or based on viewing the ad impression.

If a customer is shown an ad and he or she installs the app within 24 hours--by either clicking the ad, or directly going to the Store page of the app--that install is attributed to the campaign that delivered the impression.

An install is tracked in the Store--across phone, tablet, PC, and other Windows 10 devices--based on the customer who installed the app. The advertising engine tracks customers who see the ad and we use this information to correlate the customers who viewed the ad with the customers who installed the app. In order for the app install to be counted, a few requirements must be met:

1.  The customer has not opted out of targeting.
2.  The customer is logged in to a Microsoft account.
3.  The customer meets [COPPA](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=536558) requirements (customers that don't meet COPPA requirements cannot be tracked).

As a result, it is possible the app install tracking may *underreport* the actual number of installs generated by a **Promote your app** campaign. Please note that the total number of downloads for an app is viewable in the **Acquisitions** report in Dev Center.

## Account billing history

To see all of the transactions associated with your account, select **Billing history** in the left navigation menu.

For each transaction, we show the **Transaction date**, the appropriate **Campaign name**, the **Payment method** charged, **Payment ID**, **Billing start date**, **Billing end date**, **Total amount** of the charge, and **Payment status**.

You can also download your account billing history as a Microsoft Word document by clicking the **Download** link.
