# Update your MSI or EXE app on the Store

We recommend you submit update for your EXE or MSI apps through the Store even though they can be updated directly by you via your app that is installed on a Windows device after download from the Store. Store do not provide these updates automatically to existing users but allows users install them thru Store if your installer supports it. 

You can make changes to a published app at any time. To submit updates, go to the application's page in Partner Center and click **Update** on the right-hand side for your app submission that’s live on the Store. This will create a new submission for the application, using the info from your previous submission as a starting point. Make the changes you'd like, and then click **Publish** on Manage Store listings page. 

> [!NOTE]
> Any updates to EXE or MSI apps are subject to [Application Developer Agreement](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4OG2b) and the [Microsoft Store Policies](link: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=512933), which may be updated from time to time. You may not add any new functionality to your App via an update which requires written consent from the Customer without first providing notice to the Customer and obtaining any consents as may be required by law in the markets where you choose to distribute your App.
