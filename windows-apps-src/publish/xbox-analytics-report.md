# Xbox analytics report

The **Xbox analytics** report in the Windows Dev Center dashboard shows you statistics about how your customers are engaging with the Xbox features in your game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You’ll only see this report if you’re publishing a game for Xbox or a game that uses Xbox Live services. To do so, you must enable the [Xbox Live Creators Program](../xbox-live/get-started-with-creators/get-started-with-xbox-live-creators.md) or go through the [concept approval process](../gaming/concept-approval.md). 

This report shows various statistics about your game and its customers. For many of these statistics, we also show the **Xbox average** so you can easily see how your customers interact with Xbox compared to the average Xbox customer.

> [!NOTE]
> These statistics are from customers who are connected to Xbox Live, not all Xbox customers.

You can view the **Xbox analytics** report from the left navigation menu for your game by expanding **Analytics** and selecting **Xbox analytics**.  You can view this data in your dashboard, or [download the report](download-analytic-reports.md) to view offline.
