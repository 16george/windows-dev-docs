Before you get started coding with XIM, there are two prerequisites. First, you must have configured your app's AppXManifest with standard multiplayer networking capabilities and you must have configured its "network manifest" to declare the necessary traffic pattern templates used by XIM.

> AppXManifest capabilities and network manifests are described in more detail in their respective sections of the platform documentation; the typical XIM-specific XML to paste is provided at [XIM Project Configuration](xim-manifest.md).

Second, you'll need to have two pieces of application identity information available: the assigned Xbox Live title ID and service configuration ID provided as part of provisioning your application for access to the Xbox Live service. See your Microsoft representative for more information on acquiring these. These pieces of information will be used during initialization.
