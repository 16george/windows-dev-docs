# Create your first app

## Write a UWP app using your favorite programming language

![Build your app](images/build-your-app.png)

Welcome to the UWP platform! These tutorials will help you create your first UWP app in the language of your choice. You'll learn how to:

-   Create a UWP app project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
-   Add UI elements and code to your project.
-   Use third party libraries to add new functionality.
-   Build and debug your app on your local machine.

To get started, choose your favorite language!

## C# and XAML

Use your .NET, WPF, or Silverlight skills to build apps using XAML with C#.

* [Create a "Hello, world" app using XAML with C#](create-a-hello-world-app-xaml-universal.md)

We assume you're already comfortable with XAML and either C#. If you want to learn the basics, or just refresh your memory, try these courses from the [Microsoft Virtual Academy](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/).

And as a language refresher:
