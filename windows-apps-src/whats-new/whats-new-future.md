### EXAMPLE: Page layouts with XAML

We've updated our [XAML page layout](../design/layout/layouts-with-xaml.md) docs with new information on fluid layouts and visual states. These new features allow for greater control over how the position of elements in your app respond and adapt to the available visual space.
