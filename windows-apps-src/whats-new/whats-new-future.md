# Contribute What's New items here

As we've done in the past, add your What's New items into the appropriate category below. I'll be pulling from these entries to create our What's New topics.

(Side note - this topic is excluded from the build, and will never show up on staging or be published life. It lives in RS4 so it's never exposed publicly on github.)

## Features

**Package desktop applications with UWP projects**

Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 has updated the **Windows Application Packaging Project** template so that it's much easier to include a UWP project. You no longer  have to use a JavaScript-based packaging project, and then manually tweak the package manifest.  

See [Package an app by using Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net) for guidance on how to use this new template to package your desktop application.

See [Extend your desktop application with modern UWP components](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-extend) for guidance about how to add a UWP project to your package.

**Subscription add-ons now available to all developers**

Create and publish subscription add-ons to sell digital products in your apps and games (such as advanced features or digital content) with automated recurring billing periods. For more details, see [Enable subscription add-ons for your app](../monetize/enable-subscription-add-ons-for-your-app.md).

## Developer Guidance

**Data Access Guides**

We've added a [SQL Server guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/data-access/sql-server-databases) to show how your app can directly access a SQL Server database. No service layer required.

Also, we've completely remodeled our [SQLite guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/data-access/sqlite-databases) with cleaner look and feel, and we've included our latest best practices for storing and retrieving data in a light-weight database on the users device.

**Request ratings and reviews**

We've added a new article that shows how you can [request ratings and reviews for your app](../monetize/request-ratings-and-reviews.md). You can show a rating and review dialog in the context of your app, or you can open the rating and review page for your app in the Store.

**Color**

We've added some new guidance on how to use color in your apps for the best possible user experience. This includes API usage scenarios as well as general guidance about UI design and accessibility. We've also updated the list of user accent colors available on Xbox. [Check out the updated Color article here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/style/color)
