As we've done in the past, add your What's New items into the appropriate category below. I'll be pulling from these entries to create our What's New topics.

(Side note - this topic is excluded from the build, and will never show up on staging or be published life. It lives in RS4 so it's never exposed publicly on github.)

## Features

**Package desktop applications with UWP projects**

Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 has updated the **Windows Application Packaging Project** template so that it's much easier to include a UWP project. You no longer  have to use a JavaScript-based packaging project, and then manually tweak the package manifest.  

See [Package an app by using Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net) for guidance on how to use this new template to package your desktop application.

See [Extend your desktop application with modern UWP components](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-extend) for guidance about how to add a UWP project to your package.

## Developer Guidance

**Data Access Guides**

We've added a [SQL Server guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/data-access/sql-server-databases) to show how your app can directly access a SQL Server database. No service layer required.
Also, we've completely remodeled our [SQLite guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/data-access/sqlite-databases) with cleaner look and feel, and we've included our latest best practices for storing and retrieving data in a light-weight database on the users device.
