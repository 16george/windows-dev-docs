## Features

### EXAMPLE: Page layouts with XAML

We've updated our [XAML page layout](../design/layout/layouts-with-xaml.md) docs with new information on fluid layouts and visual states. These new features allow for greater control over how the position of elements in your app respond and adapt to the available visual space.

### C++/WinRT
[C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/) is a new, entirely standard, modern C++17 language projection for Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs. It's implemented solely in header files, and designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern Windows API. With C++/WinRT, you can author and consume WinRT APIs using any standards-compliant C++17 compiler. For your C++ applications&mdash;from Win32 to UWP&mdash;use C++/WinRT to keep your code standard, modern, and clean, and your application lightweight and fast.

### Package resource indexing (PRI) APIs and custom build systems
With the [package resource indexing (PRI) APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-resources/pri-apis-custom-build-systems), you can develop a custom build system for your UWP app's resources. The build system will be able to create, version, and dump package resource index (PRI) files to whatever level of complexity your UWP app needs. If you have a custom build system that currently uses the MakePri.exe command-line tool then, for increased performance and control, we recommend that you switch over to calling the PRI APIs instead of calling MakePri.exe.
