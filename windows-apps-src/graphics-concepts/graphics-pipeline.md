Data flows from input to output through each of the configurable or programmable stages.All of the stages can be configured using the Direct3D API. Stages that feature common shader cores (the rounded rectangular blocks) are programmable by using the [HLSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb509561) programming language. This makes the pipeline extremely flexible and adaptable.The most commonly used are the Vertex Shader (VS) stage and the Pixel Shader (PS) stage. If you don't provide even these shader stages, a default no-op, pass-through vertex and pixel shader are used.![diagram of the data flow in the direct3d 11 programmable pipeline](images/d3d11-pipeline-stages.jpg)## Input Assembler stage | | ||-|-||Purpose|The [Input Assembler (IA) stage](input-assembler-stage--ia-.md) supplies primitive and adjacency data to the pipeline, such as triangles, lines and points, including semantics IDs to help make shaders more efficient by reducing processing to primitives that haven't already been processed.||Input|Primitive data (triangles, lines, and/or points), from user-filled buffers in memory.
