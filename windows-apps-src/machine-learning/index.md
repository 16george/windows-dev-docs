# Windows Machine Learning

Windows Machine Learning (ML) evaluates trained machine learning models locally on Windows 10 devices, allowing developers to use pre-trained models within their applications. The platform provides hardware-accelerated performance by leveraging the device's CPU or GPU to compute evaluations for both classical Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning.
