# Windows Machine Learning samples

The following sample UWP apps demonstrate how to use Windows Machine Learning and are available to download from the [Windows-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning) repo on GitHub.

## MNIST Multilayer Perceptron

This sample uses the CNTK MNIST model to interpret a numeric digit drawn by the user, demonstrating how to use the Visual Studio Tools for AI plugin with Windows ML code generation. You can walk through the sample with a step-by-step tutorial in [Get Started](get-started.md).

## SqueezeNet Image Classifier

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/SqueezeNetObjectDetection) classifies an image that the user inputs from a collection, demonstrating the basic usage of Windows ML. 

## Artistic image style transfer

[This sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Samples/UWP/CandyStyleTransfer) transfers an artistic style called Candy onto an image that the user inputs from a file or a photo captured. 

## Windows Machine Learning Explorer

This sample is a data driven and generic application that serves as a launch pad to bootstrap ML models to be evaluated by Windows ML. It currently includes a scenario of circuit board defect detection model that can detect pictures and a real-time camera feed of a printed circuit board.
