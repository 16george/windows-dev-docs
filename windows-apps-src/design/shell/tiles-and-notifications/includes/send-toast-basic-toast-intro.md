In Windows 10, your toast notification content is described using an adaptive language that allows great flexibility with how your notification looks. See the [toast content documentation](adaptive-interactive-toasts.md) for more information.

We'll start with a simple text-based notification. Construct the notification content (using the Notifications library), and show the notification!
