# Expander
Expander provides a standard interaction for showing more content in a container that pushes adjacent content while expanding and collapsing. It is often used when some content is only relevant some of the time (for example to read more information or access additional options for an item).

An Expander cannot be light dismissed and is independent of the contents inside it, including controls. 

**Get the Windows UI Library**

      The **Expander** control requires the Windows UI Library, a NuGet package that contains new controls and UI features for Windows apps. For more info, including installation instructions, see [Windows UI Library](/uwp/toolkits/winui/).
