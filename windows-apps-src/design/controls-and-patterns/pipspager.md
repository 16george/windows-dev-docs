# PipsPager
A PipsPager allows the user to navigate through a paginated collection and is independent of the content shown. Use this control when the content in the layout is not explicitly ordered by relevancy or you desire a glyph-based representation of numbered pages. PipsPagers are commonly used in photo viewers, app lists, carousels, and when display space is limited.

      The **PipsPager** control requires the Windows UI Library, a NuGet package that contains new controls and UI features for Windows apps. For more info, including installation instructions, see [Windows UI Library](/uwp/toolkits/winui/).
