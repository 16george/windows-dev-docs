# Controls for UWP apps

![Controls](../images/controls-2x.png)

In UWP app development, a <i>control</i> is a UI element that displays content or enables interaction. Controls are the building blocks of the user interface. A <i>pattern</i> is a recipe for combining several controls to make something new.

We provide 45+ controls for you to use, ranging from simple buttons to powerful data controls like the grid view.  These controls are a part of the Fluent Design System and can help you create a bold, scalable UI that looks great on all devices and screen sizes.

The articles in this section provide design guidance and coding instructions for adding controls & patterns to your UWP app.

## Intro

General instructions and code examples for adding and styling controls in XAML and C#.

| ![WinUI logo](images/winui-logo-64x64.png) | Some controls are only available in the Windows UI Library (WinUI), a NuGet package that contains new controls and UI features. To get it, see the [Windows UI Library overview and installation instructions](/uwp/toolkits/winui/).<br/>Starting with WinUI 2.2, the default style for many controls has been updated to use rounded corners. For more info, see [Corner radius](/windows/uwp/design/style/rounded-corner). |

## Alphabetical index

Detailed information about specific controls and patterns. (For a list sorted by function, see [Index of controls by function](controls-by-function.md).)
