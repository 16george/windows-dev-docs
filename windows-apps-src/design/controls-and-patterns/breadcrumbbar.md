# Breadcrumb Bar
A BreadcrumbBar provides the direct path of pages or folders to the current location. It is often used for situations where the user's navigation trail (in a file system or menu system) needs to be persistently visible and the user may need to go back to a previous location. 

**Get the Windows UI Library**

      The **BreadcrumbBar** control requires the Windows UI Library, a NuGet package that contains new controls and UI features for Windows apps. For more info, including installation instructions, see [Windows UI Library](/uwp/toolkits/winui/).
